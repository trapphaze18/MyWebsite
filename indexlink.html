<p>An aspiring software engineer, hoping to become apart of the gaming community further by becoming a video game developer, and contributing to games we know and love, or new ones we are soon to know and love! Dons has been playing video games since the early N64 days, and never really stopped, from owning an N64, to the collection of Playstation's 1-4, GameBoy's, Xbox's PSP's you name it.
The main focus currently is Call of Duty, but isnt a stranger to any other games like Ghost of Tsushima, Skyrim, Pokemon, the Skate series, and even a handful of mobile games.</p>

  you get those old school Pokemon vibes.
